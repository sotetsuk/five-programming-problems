See [Five programming problems every Software Engineer should be able to solve in less than 1 hour](https://www.shiftedup.com/2015/05/07/five-programming-problems-every-software-engineer-should-be-able-to-solve-in-less-than-1-hour)

# Commentary
I didn't solve these problems in 1 hour (almost +20min). I wish I will become a **Software Engineer** in the future.  
After I tried, I found [a nice solution of 5th problem](http://zipsan.hatenablog.jp/entry/20150924/1443035758) using ```itertools.product``` and ```eval```. It's great.
